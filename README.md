# Fresh fruits and vegetables are in greater demand as a result of rising living standards. Due to their perishable nature,
# it is extremely difficult to preserve the nutritional value and freshness of agricultural products after harvest. Inadequate processing,
# a lack of suitable refrigerated equipment, and inadequate cold chain logistics facilities have led to significant losses in fruits and 
# vegetables. In the world, food is lost at a rate of 40â€“50% per year for fruits and vegetables. Low temperature slows bacterial proliferation,
# respiratory intensity, and metabolism, which delays spoiling (Lagarda-Leyva et al, 2023). 
# This simulation model developed to help the manager of a refrigerated storage facility determine the appropriate number of 
# forklifts and specialist handling machines needed to meet service standards when dealing with food shipments in order to avoid the losses
